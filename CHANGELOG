# WIP

- Setup ESlint and Prettier with a precommit
- Set up redux by creating a 2 middlewares and one enhancer
- The redux-thunk middleware, which allows simple asynchronous use of dispatch.
- A middleware which logs dispatched actions and the resulting new state(logger)
- An enhancer which logs the time taken for the reducers to process each action(monitor reducer)
